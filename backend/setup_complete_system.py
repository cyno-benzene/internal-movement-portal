Complete System Setup Script for Internal Mobility Platform
============================================================

This script handles BOTH fresh database setup and existing database upgrades:

üÜï FRESH DATABASE:
- Creates all tables from scratch using SQLAlchemy models
- Sets up complete system schema
- Populates with comprehensive test data

üîÑ EXISTING DATABASE:
- Adds missing tables (invitations, invitation_decisions, job_comments)
- Adds new columns for features
- Preserves existing data
- Updates schema to latest version

üìã WHAT IT DOES:
1. Database Migration:
   - Creates all tables if they don't exist
   - Adds system tables (invitations, invitation_decisions, job_comments, work_experiences)
   - Adds new columns (note, optional_skills, months_experience, date_of_joining, reporting_officer_id, etc.)
   - Handles PostgreSQL-specific features

2. Test Data Creation:
   - 10 users (employees, managers, HR, admin) with enhanced profile fields
   - Realistic reporting structure and company tenure data
   - 10+ realistic work experience entries with LinkedIn-style data
   - 6 jobs with realistic descriptions
   - Sample invitations with different statuses
   - Shortlisted candidates for discovery workflow
   - Notifications for different user types

3. System Workflow Setup:
   - Employee opt-out capabilities
   - Manager discovery and shortlist workflow
   - Invitation-response system

üöÄ USAGE:
- For fresh setup: Just run this script
- For upgrades: Run this script on existing database
- SQLAlchemy handles table creation safely
- All operations use IF NOT EXISTS for safety

‚ö†Ô∏è  REQUIREMENTS:
- PostgreSQL database running
- Correct DATABASE_URL in settings
- Database user with CREATE TABLE permissions
